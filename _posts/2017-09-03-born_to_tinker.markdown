Ever since I was a young boy I loved to tinker. Tinker is such a trendy word these days, but when I started the only thing one thought of when hearing the word tinker was Tinker Toys. That doesn't mean that I was unique in my desire to see how things worked, however my desire to delve deeper has never subsided.

Growing up, I was introduced to improvisation at an early age. My father was a professional jazz musician and teacher. He instilled in me the notion that music is a language and when you improvise you are telling a story that needs to make sense. Just as a sentence is made up of nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc. Music is made up of statements or riffs and riffs make up a melody or complete musical statement. The idea is to express yourself simply and sincerely.  These days, I am also a professional musician and I take this advice to heart every time I pick up my guitar. 

Why am I telling you this? Well, as I have gotten more and more into computers and technology, I have come to appreciate the language and makeup of this universe.  I see many parallels between the language of music and the language of computers. Where music contains things like notes and rests, sharps and flats, melodies, rhythm and harmony, computer code contains elements, variables, statements, headers, styles, etc. Each can be used in artistic ways to express something to the observer. Each can take simple things and turn them into powerful and moving forces that effect the observer.

This kind of thing interests me. This is why I have decided to learn software development. I look forward to this journey and I can already feel my brain expanding in ways that I haven't in a long time.
